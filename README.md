# Extracting Insights from Video with Multimodal AI Analysis

## Overview 

In this guide, we’ll take text-rich videos (instructional content, meetings) and extract still images and audio. In order to perform OCR and speech recognition using Whisper, we’ll process the images through [Snowflake Cortex AI](https://www.snowflake.com/en/product/features/cortex/) using `PARSE_DOCUMENT` and `AI_TRANSCRIBE`. To extract key moments and semantic events we will then process through Qwen2.5-VL on [Snowpark Container Services](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/overview) (SPCS). Lastly, we will store the analysis from all three models into tables, and allow analytical queries around meeting productivity to be run on the data.
